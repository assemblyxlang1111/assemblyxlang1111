# 👋 Welcome to assemblyxlang1111's GitHub!

## 🛠️ Assembly Developer | Low-Level Enthusiast | Performance Hacker

Hey there! I'm **assemblyxlang1111**, a passionate developer focused on **Assembly language**, system internals, and low-level programming. I love pushing hardware to its limits and squeezing every last cycle of performance.

### 🔧 Tech I Use
- 🧠 **Assembly (x86, x64, NASM)**
- ⚙️ Low-level system programming
- 🪛 Reverse engineering & debugging (IDA Pro, Ghidra, x64dbg)
- 💾 C/C++ for interfacing with Assembly
- 🧪 Writing and optimizing shellcode

### 🚀 Projects and Goals
- Building a minimalist OS kernel in pure Assembly
- Writing fast & compact routines for embedded systems
- Creating educational examples of real-world Assembly use

### 📚 Recent Work
Check out some of my pinned repositories to see what I’ve been assembling (pun intended 😉). From bootloaders to handcrafted machine code — if it's low-level, I'm in!

### 📫 Let's Connect
- 💬 Open to collabs on systems programming & reverse engineering
- 📨 Feel free to DM or open an issue to get in touch
